## Challenges I ran into 💪🏻

There are lots of challenges I faced while building this project.

First, there are lots of issues to Installing unity 3D editor in our local system, but after research and developer installation guide can help me a lot and finally install unity 3D editor in my local system.

Second, I face a some issues with large files to push on the main GitHub repo. For this reason I upload my files directly on the github using upload files way.

Third, This error massage I solve by searching on stackover flow because lots of developers are face this issue at first time while build projects on unity 3D. Here basically I configure the camera option and give allow access to my system antivirus software to access my webcam to use by unity 3D editor.

Fourth, Database integration display a error massage but after add license key properly it show a database selection option where I select my previously build database on vuforia.
